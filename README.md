## THIS PROGRAM WAS WRITTEN FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY!! I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANYTHING YOU DO WITH THIS PROGRAM!
## I DO NOT CONDONE CHEATING, I SIMPLY WROTE THIS PROGRAM TO LEARN MORE ABOUT REVERSE ENGINEERING :)

**roadmap:**
- external memory management:
	- attach to application
	- read/write bytes
	- scan for patterns found in ida

- application specific bypasses:
	- find pattern in ida
	- patch bytes in memory to bypass specific checks/callbacks
	
	- im expecting more to come as i continue to reverse dynamically/dig deeper. the above is only going to bypass key presses so far..
