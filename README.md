**roadmap:**
- external memory management:
	- attach to application :white_check_mark:
	- read/write bytes :white_check_mark:
	- scan for patterns found in ida :white_check_mark:

- application specific bypasses:
	- find pattern in ida :white_check_mark:
	- patch bytes in memory to bypass specific checks/callbacks :white_check_mark:?:x:
	
	- im expecting more to come as i continue to reverse dynamically/dig deeper. the above is only going to bypass key presses so far..
